# cnkit

cnkit is a collection of scripts and configurations that provide automated ways of deploying Cardano nodes and staking pools following the best practices, with the ultimate goal of helping to achieve a secure and highly available setup. 

The components of this project are in alpha stage, code provided isn't thoroughly tested, and almost no documentation is available, so at the moment they are meant to be used only in develpment and test environments. 

Right now this is a meta project for:
